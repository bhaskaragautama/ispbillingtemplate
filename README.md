# How to Use

Nothing special. Just copy the repository or download and extract it and you are ready to go.

# Project Description

This project is a mockup for ISP Billing System Project. We code the mockup instead of using mockup tools like Figma, Axure, etc. because we are a small team where the UI/UX Designer and Front-end Programmer is one man. The idea is to kill two birds with one stone where the design is the front-end code (not all but mostly, considering the templating system and so on).

# Font, CSS, & JS Libraries

-   We use a customized [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/) as our main CSS Framework. Although it's not a pure CSS framework, but hey, productivity comes first!
-   [Poppins font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) for the win!
-   For the icon, we use [Font Awesome Free 6.2.1](https://fontawesome.com/v6/docs/changelog/#v6-2-1). This one is pretty old, I think we need to upgrade it soon :frowning:
-   We use [DataTables 1.13.8](https://datatables.net/) to enhance our table view and functionality. It is a jQuery plugin, thus we need to include this thing bellow:
-   [jQuery 3.7.1](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js). The most famous ~~and overwrought implementation~~ JavaScript library out there. We don't use front-end framework yet, and considering many developers have abandoned it, the time for us to give it a little love is here. We love you, jQuery :heart:

# Design Style

It is a clean design, using a bento box layout here and there, and pill shaped things for mostly everything.

> [!NOTE]
> The current theme is light. Dark theme is not available yet, because you know, we are just getting started so it is still in the morning here. Ha ðŸ¥²

# Things to Note

Here are some things that still unclear or need to be considered for the current mockup version:

-   [ ] Is the customers always have their plan submitted? I mean is the plan mandatory for them?
-   [ ] I think we need some details in customer data. Such as register date. This is linked to how the customer is billed.
-   [ ] Do we need to make a customized active time for a plan? Like a plan that active for one week or two, or maybe in a couple of days. Or a generalized active time that is one month (30 days?) for any plan.
-   [ ] The billing mechanism. Since the customer is signed up, pay a plan, its due, what if the payment comes late, etc. All of them, we need all of the business proccess here.
-   [ ] And here to, the business proccess. Damn I can't see anything!
